    <div class="desc">
      <p class="contents">It is important that people should be aware of the environment and planet Earth because we all
        need earth for a chance of survival as it is our only home. Damage to the environment could cause the extinction
        of an unreal amount of species, greatly reducing the biodiversity, and it could even lead to our own speciesâ€™
        extinction.</p>

      <h2>Environmental Issues And Their Impact</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="contents">Deforestation is one large issue involving the environment. Animals living within trees have
        their homes stripped away from them because of this action. They will be forced out in search of a new and safer
        place to call home. Trees also help turn carbon dioxide into the oxygen we need and breathe through
        photosynthesis, so not only is cutting down trees harmful for the environment, but also for our own species.
        Another issue involving the environment include but is not limited to the mass-production and littering of
        plastic. These plastics may end up in the water, where unsuspecting marine wildlife could consume and/or
        suffocate in the plastics thrown out, unbeknownst to themselves.
        The production of pollution originating from factories or vehicles is another issue. The smoke and pollution may
        reach the ozone layer and create a hole in it, allowing the Sun's ultraviolet rays to enter the atmosphere and
        onto the Earth, causing a plethora of problems. Health issues will arise both from the pollution and the
        ultraviolet rays.</p>

        <div class="feature-description">
          <p>Lastly, acid rain is a large issue. Acid rain is caused by pollution emitting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
            oxides into the air and coming in contact with rainwater, causing the pH of rainwater - usually around 5 -
            to drop to as acidic as 3. This might also pollute other bodies of water and the environment itself as
            everything will be filled with acid. Children who play out in the rain will be harmed by this acidic
            rainwater.</p>

          <h3>Impacts on Wildlife</h3>
          <hr style="color:white">
          <p>The impact on the wildlife on Earth is similar to the impact on human health. Pollution may reach wildlife
            and will likely cause health issues for wildlife. Littering, notably plastic, will cause the deaths of
            different forms of wildlife. For example, sea turtles may be suffocated by plastic bags in which they
            unknowingly insert their heads into.</p>

          <p>Overpopulation may also become a problem. If there are too many humans and/or living organisms, there might
            not be enough resources to supply the demands of every single living organism on Earth. For example, too
            many humans may cause food supplies to run out, starting a global starvation.</p>

          <p>Acid rain may affect the soil on the ground. The acidic conditions of the rainwater will damage the soil
            for future growth, which will impact the environment as living organisms such as plants won't be able to
